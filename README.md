> Small and fast pseudo random number generator. Not the most complex or bullet-proof of PRNGs out there, but fast and small when you want to have "predictable" random numbers. I don't know the period of this generator: I've run a script that generates a million numbers per second and after a day and a half (188 billions iterations) the sequence still did not repeat.  So I guess it's good enough.

### How to Install

```sh
$ npm install rkgttr-prng --save-dev
```
or

```sh
$ yarn add rkgttr-prng --dev
```

### Getting Started

```js
var Prng = require('rkgttr-prng');

var prng = new Prng();
prng.gen();
```
or

```js
import Prng from 'rkgttr-prng';

let prng = new Prng();
prng.gen();
```
When creating a PRNG instance, you can pass a seed to it:

```js
let prng = new Prng(12);
```
